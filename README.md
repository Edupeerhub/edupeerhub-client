# Edupeerhub Client

## Project Overview

**Edupeerhub** is a proprietary peer-powered ed-tech platform designed to democratize access to quality education for Nigerian secondary school students. By connecting learners with vetted university undergraduates and recent graduates, Edupeerhub enables personalized, live one-on-one tutoring sessions focused on exam preparation for WAEC, NECO, and JAMB.

This repository contains the **client-side web application** for Edupeerhub. The frontend (client) and backend (server) are maintained as separate codebases.
